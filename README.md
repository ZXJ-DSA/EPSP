## Introduction

This is the source code of the VLDB 2023 paper "Decoupling Dynamic Shortest Distance and Graph Partition [Experiment, Analysis & Benchmark]" (submitted). Please refer to the paper for the algorithm details.

## Algorithms

The following codes contain the index construction and index update



## Data

#### Datasets

The original datasets can be downloaded from `http://users.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml` and `http://konect.cc/`. Note that preprocessing is indispensable before running. 



## Dependency

`g++` and `boost`.

All the codes are runnable after make.
